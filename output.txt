Processing the PCAP files
The pcap files from this experiment have already been converted to flow JSON files
You need to do the following before continuing:
1) Create a training_json directory
2) Create an eval_json directory
3) You need to move files from the json directory into the training_json and eval_json directory based on what you are trying to evaluate
4) You need to put the device label in each of the json files in the training_json and eval_json directories
5) Press enter to continue on this prompt

Note: The previous steps will not be repeated unless you delete the json directory. So you can safely stop the program here and restart it.
Press Enter to continue...
